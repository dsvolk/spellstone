It may not look like much from here, but what do you expect for something near the literal edge of the observable universe? If you were there when this light was emitted, you'd a) be at the beginning of time and b) be looking at an entire galaxy containing an enormous black hole at its heart. It's the most distant black hole we've semi-directly detected. That's cool enough on its own, but as an added bonus, this one smudge may have solved the mystery of the origin of the supermassive black holes in our modern universe. Introducing Abel 2744. It's a giant cluster of galaxies around 4 billion light years away, basically our backyard, cosmologically speaking. The most interesting thing about Abel 2744, at least for us today, isn't what's in this cluster itself, but what's behind it. The cluster lives in a vast halo of dark matter that warps space across its 4 million light year span. Light from distant objects traveling through the cluster is deflected and magnified. The cluster is a stupendous gravitational lens that enables us to see much further than our puny human-made telescopes would normally allow. That's why the Hubble Space Telescope studied Abel 2744 in detail, and why it was one of the early must-do's for the James Webb Space Telescope. And this is where our smudge got interesting. JWST observes deep into infrared wavelengths and showed that this object has eye-arc colours consistent with a galaxy whose normally visible light has been stretched out by the expanding universe, increasing or redshifting its wavelength by a factor of over 10. Higher redshift means larger distance, and a redshift of 10.1 in this case means this light has been traveling to us for around 13.2 billion years, coming to us from a time near the beginning of time, when the universe was less than 3.5% its current age. That earned our smudge the name UH-Z1 for Ultra High Redshift Galaxy Number 1, where the Z is the symbol for redshift. That's cool, but JWST has now found galaxies quite a bit more distant than this. The really exciting moment came when we pointed another orbiting satellite at this smudge. This is the image by the Chandra X-ray Telescope. It turns out there are a lot of X-rays coming from this little blob. Now, X-rays are much harder to bring to sharp focus, so the 4 pixels of the X-ray light aren't coming from across this spread out region, but rather from something inside that region. There's really only one known way for a galaxy to be blasting out X-rays at this level, and that's by harboring a quasar. To refresh your memory, a quasar is when a supermassive black hole, an SMBH, that lives in the center of every galaxy starts feeding. As matter swirls towards the black hole, it's superheated until it outshines the entire surrounding galaxy. And just before it reaches the black hole, conditions get so crazy that the space outside the black hole glows bright with high-energy X-rays. Based on the amount of X-ray light and the distance, we can estimate that the black hole must be 40 million times our sun's mass. That's 10 times the mass of the Milky Way's own SMBH. UHZ1 is the most distant quasar ever discovered, which makes it the earliest known quasar, and so the earliest black hole that we have evidence for. So with that out of the way, let's get to the good stuff. To understand why UHZ1 is so exciting, you have to understand one of the biggest debates in cosmology - the origin of supermassive black holes. Essentially every galaxy in the modern universe has at its core a black hole that's 100,000 to several billion times the mass of the sun. We also see much smaller black holes, so-called stellar-mass black holes, that can be in the rough range of 10 to 100 solar masses. Oddly, we don't see black holes in the middle range of 100 to 100,000, and we'll come back to why that's odd. Now, we know how to make stellar black holes - they're what you get when the core of a massive star collapses on itself after the star dies. So how do you make a supermassive black hole? That's the big question. It could be that they grew from the very first stellar corpses in the early universe, gulping down gas and merging with other black holes for billions of years to reach their current enormous sizes. But over the last decade or so, as we looked to greater and greater distances, we started to find quasars shining out from the first billion years of cosmic time - quasars powered by supermassive black holes that should not have had enough time to get that big. There are two potential solutions to this conundrum. Either black holes started small and grew way, way faster than we thought they could, or they started much bigger than the black holes that form in stellar deaths in the modern universe. These are the small seed and the heavy seed models respectively. UHZ1 is going to help us choose between them. Let's start with the small seed model. Can a stellar corpse grow into a quasar engine in less than a billion years? Well, it's tricky. There's a limit to how fast a black hole can feed, even with an endless supply of gas. As gas spiraling into a black hole heats up, it blasts out radiation which pushes on the infalling gas and counters the black hole's gravity. Bigger black holes can eat more and radiate more, but there's always an approximate upper limit that increases with that mess. It's called the Eddington limit. You can calculate how big a black hole would grow feeding at this maximum rate for say a billion years, and the answer is not big enough to explain those early quasars. That said, there are various tricks we can include to make the small seed model work. There are scenarios in which black holes can feed somewhat faster than the Eddington limit, although they still need to feed non-stop to reach supermassive status so quickly, which itself is a problem. Or you can form a lot of black holes close to each other and have them merge very quickly, or you can start out with really, really big stars that leave behind black holes that are maybe a hundred or even a thousand times larger than those produced today. In the modern universe, all the heavy elements released in past supernovae cause gas clouds to fragment as they collapse, leading to smaller stars. But the pristine hydrogen and helium that filled the universe in the beginning held together as it collapsed, probably leading to gigantic stars and commensurately massive, but still not supermassive, black holes. With a combination of these tricks, fast and consistent feeding and biggish stellar black hole seeds, it's possible to make supermassive black holes in under a billion years. This still doesn't explain why we don't see any black holes in the 100-100,000 solar mass range. If SMBHs grew from stellar black holes by passing through this range, then you'd expect some stragglers to still be in that range, but that doesn't seem to be the case. Okay, so let's try the heavy seed model. What if the seeds of supermassive black holes weren't even born from the hyperdense cores of dead stars? And in fact, it's actually a misconception that you need extremely dense matter to make a black hole. For any given mass, there's a particular size that that mass needs to be crushed into in order to form a black hole. This is the Schwarzschild radius. For the sun, it's around three kilometers, and a solar mass crammed within that radius would have the same density as a typical 3,000 meter tall mountain crammed into a cubic centimeter. On the other hand, a typical chonky supermassive black hole of a billion solar masses has a Schwarzschild radius the size of Neptune's orbit. A billion suns crammed into that region would have the density of cotton candy. That's right. Fill the solar system with cotton candy and you'd get an instant giant black hole. The early universe did not contain significant quantities of cotton candy, at least as far as we can tell. But it was filled with a lot of gas that would later form stars and galaxies. As that gas started to collapse to make those things, the resulting proto-galactic clouds may have had cores dense enough to collapse directly into black holes without ever forming a star. Again, this only works in the early universe where unpolluted hydrogen and helium doesn't tend to fragment as it collapses. And as it happens, theoretical calculations of the expected sizes of these direct collapse black holes are right around the 100,000 solar mass mark. That gives us a way to go straight from gas to the smallest SMBHs without having to grow from stellar seeds through the intermediate range. And once you have a small SMBH, a pretty sensible rate of feeding could turn it into a large SMBH in mere hundreds of millions of years. Okay, great. Between our two models, small versus heavy seed, it's looking like the heavy seed model feels more plausible. So let's see what the new player, UHZ1, has to say about this. Previous record holders for the most distant quasars like J1342+0928, J0313-1806, and J1007+2115 are all similarly massive and they had already put the small seed formation theory under a lot of stress over the past few years. But they were all found right around the 700 million years after the Big Bang mark, just on the boundary of the amount of time needed to grow a small seed, assuming some very creative astrophysics to allow a really cosmic bulking phase. But UHZ1 shaves 200 million years off the allowed growth time. If it was marginally possible to grow a small seed into an SMBH before, it's now feeling nearly impossible. Let's look a bit more closely at this object to try to make this more concrete. Based on the JWST images, we can get an idea of the amount of starlight versus the quasar light in this object. Even those images are dominated by quasar light. The galaxy has around 40 million suns worth of mass in stars, the same as its mass in a black hole, and that's around a thousand times less than the stars in the Milky Way. This isn't unusual in itself. We expect galaxies from so long ago to still be building up mass and converting gas into stars. But for most of the universe's history, we see a pretty tight correlation between the number of stars in a galaxy and the mass of the central black hole. That has been taken by some to indicate that galaxies and their central black holes grow together in relative lockstep. UHZ1 suggests otherwise. It tells us that the black hole starts relatively enormous and then the stellar mass catches up. UHZ1 may represent the very first in a new class of object called an OBG for overly massive black hole galaxy or outsized black hole galaxy. OBGs are objects hypothesized to exist in the early universe in which the black hole and stellar masses are around the same. The amount of infrared and x-ray light coming from UHZ1 is consistent with simulations of OBG formation. So maybe this class of object is no longer hypothetical. If so, that tells us a lot. OBGs only work if their central black hole is formed by direct collapse, not through the growth of a stellar remnant. Overall things are looking pretty good for the heavy seed model but quite a bit less good for the small seed model. Now it's not quite a smoking gun. For example maybe UHZ1 is just weird. Perhaps its SMBH formed in an unusual way. For example from a rare and massive primordial black hole or in an exotic environment like a quasi-star. But the fact that observations of UHZ1 line up so well with the direct collapse and the OBG model would tend to disfavor these alternate explanations. At least in UHZ1's case. And even if UHZ1 is an OBG it doesn't mean other supermassive black holes couldn't have formed from small seeds. But in general the case for the latter as an important source for SMBHs is being whittled away. So what's next? Well we keep looking. UHZ1 is the first of its kind but in astronomy where there's one there's often many and hopefully soon we'll find the many. As JWST and Chandra continue their good work we'll develop a clearer and clearer picture of what the earliest times were like as we discover more distant glimmers of the earliest stars and quasars that first lit up a newly born spacetime. Hey guys two things before we go. First I want to tell you about Fascinating Fails over on PBS Terra. It's a show about scientific discoveries that were made by accident.

В этом выпуске мы с Таней обсуждаем, как живется на Бали.', '', 'Таня, привет! Расскажи, пожалуйста, чем ты занималась до февраля 22 года?', '', 'До февраля 22 года я занималась своей компанией Kinky Company. Это секс-просветительская инициатива. Мы делаем в основном, и это, наверное, самый известный наш проект, вечеринки, кинки-пати. Но помимо этого мы делаем фестивали, мастер-классы, вебинары, курсы, маркеты, лектории. То есть довольно много разнообразной деятельности, которая призвана людям дарить сексуальную свободу. Помимо этого у меня был тогда еще стартап, который называется DEEP. Это тоже такое онлайн-пространство для сексуального разнообразия. Это была его изначальная идея. Потом мы немножко переделали. Сейчас это пространство для нового телесного опыта. Довольно близкая идея, но чуть-чуть другая. И, собственно, я жила в Москве, но, как ни странно, уже думала уезжать из Москвы куда-нибудь. И буквально вот в январе 2022 года написала это себе в целях на год. Я, правда, совершенно не так себя это представляла. Но, тем не менее, я много путешествовала, вела свой бизнес, занималась интересными делами.', '', 'Где ты вообще встретила февраль 2022 года?', '', 'У меня магическая история, потому что я в ноябре 2021 года формила себе визу на Бали. Тогда еще были сложные оформления, которые занимали по несколько месяцев. Мы заранее этим озаботились и собирались в январе туда лететь. Потому что я уже очень много лет зимую в Азии. В общем-то, я уже даже не помню, сколько лет я проводила зиму в Азии и готовилась к своей классической зимовке. Мы получаем визы в ноябре и где-то в декабре там начинается какая-то движуха, и Бали закрывается. Я сейчас плохо помню детали. И мы принимаем решение лететь в Таиланд, в котором мы будем ждать открытия Бали. Потому что виза тогда стоила 300 баксов на каждого. То есть, ну, как-то не хотелось, в общем, чтобы она пропала. И, соответственно, мы полетели в Таиланд и там ждали, когда Бали откроется, чтобы потом полететь на Бали. Чтобы у нас была такая двойная зимовка и в Таиланде, и на Бали. И, собственно, Бали открылся 14 февраля, я очень хорошо помню. Пока там он открылся, пока мы, в общем, очнулись, пока билеты стали доступны. Я помню, что числа типа 16-18 я начала уже искать билеты. Ближайшие классные билеты были на 24-е. А 4-го марта у меня уже были в Москве встречи и дела. И мне все говорят, Тань, ну ты типа сумасшедшая, нахрен тебе лететь на неделю на Бали. Ну типа, что за бред? А у меня была какая-то очень-очень сильная уверенность, что надо это сделать. Ну, как бы я до сих пор не понимаю, откуда это было. Потому что я в предыдущей своей зимовке на Бали не посетила вулкан. И весь год вообще не могла успокоиться от этой мысли. То есть я была там, жила там два месяца на Бали и так и не поднялась на вулкан. А тут это как бы такой моветон. Все поднимаются на вулканы. И я говорю, ребята, если я еще год буду думать про непокоренный вулкан, я просто охерею. Поэтому я полечу на Бали, это крюк, 4 часа 5 на самолете, поднимусь на вулкан и полечу в Москву. Типа, вот. И все говорили мне, что я сумасшедшая, но мне часто так говорят, у меня к этому толерантность.', '', 'Вот, соответственно, я купила эти билеты, не стала брать билеты в Москву, потому что тоже подумала, ну, может, не 4-го, может, 8-го полечу. У меня там эти встречи, в принципе, немножко были flexible. Но план был вот к 10 марта точно возвращаться в Москву, потому что у нас уже стояли мероприятия, там у нас уже куча была работы запланирована. И 24 февраля я приземлилась на индонезийской земле. Мой самолет сел. Там еще была такая интересная деталь, она заключалась в том, что надо было еще 5 дней отсидеть карантина. То есть я собиралась отсидеть карантин 5 дней, а потом подняться на вулкан и лететь в Москву. Вот, соответственно, мы приехали в карантинный отель. У нас был перелет, типа, сутки примерно занял, потому что мы летели с пересадкой. Вот, поэтому я весь день была в самолетах без связи. Как только мы прилетели, мы прилетели ночью, мы сразу легли спать. Вот, и поэтому я уже только очень с большой задержкой и запозданием на следующий день открыла новости. Я открыла новости и поняла, что остаюсь, что не зря я прилетела. Вообще, это очень правильное было решение.', '', 'То есть у тебя не было идеи, чтобы собрать вещи, что-то сделать, и все, улетела?', '', 'Некий план на переезд ставила, правда, я хотела в Берлин улетать. Вот, это первый был фактор. Второй был фактор, что я как будто бы... У меня все еще была эта идея, типа, нафиг я прилетела? Понятно, что ради вулкана, но какое-то ощущение было, да? И тут оно тоже как будто бы сложилось. И третье, если честно, ну, меня охватила абсолютная паника. Я даже не могу эти чувства описать, если честно. Я была очень благодарна судьбе за то, что я была заперта в карантинном отеле первые пять дней. Потому что, ну, меня настолько сильно крыло, что я была бы точно из тех, кто побежал бы к посольству там с какими-нибудь... Ну, то есть, скорее всего, я ничего не смогла бы сделать, ну, и не могла бы. Но у меня было настолько много энергии что-то делать, да, каким-то образом вообще переваривать свое негодование и протест внутренний, что я думаю, что я бы что-то начала делать. И для меня это было бы точно не лучшим решением. И поэтому тот факт, что я вот просто была заперта в этом... Там еще был такой, ну, небольшой тоже деталь. Мы когда выбирали этот отель, там были варианты, где ты заперт в комнате, а были варианты, где ты заперт как бы в отеле. То есть ты можешь выходить из комнаты и доходить до бассейна. Это стоило там в 2 или в 3 раза дороже. И сначала тоже казалось бредовой идеей, потому что я такая себе говорю, блин, да у меня куча вообще книжек, фильмов, курсов непосмотренных. Че, я в комнате не посижу? Да это мечта. Просто заприте меня в комнате, и я буду там заниматься делами, которые были отложены в течение всего отпуска. Но опять-таки какое-то вот очень такое внутреннее интуитивное чувство ставило нас в самый последний момент поменять решение и взять себе отель с выходом к бассейну. Хотя, повторюсь, это было тоже нерационально. Мы поняли, что у нас есть возможность не только сидеть в номере, а мы еще вдвоем были, но и там доходить до спортзала, доходить до бассейна, прогуливаться, пусть по небольшому, но территории. Это тоже очень спасало. Мы прям оставляли телефоны в номере и половину дня проводили вот в этом маленьком, маленькой территории отеля, которая нам была предоставлена карантинной. И мы еще типа занимались там у нас, из-за того, что был очень дорогой отель со всякими плюшками, у нас бесплатно входили всякие мастер-классы по завязыванию полотенец в лебедей, по собиранию вот этих их подношений из цветов и фруктов, знаешь, по связыванию сумок из бамбука. И мы посетили абсолютно все. Просто мы ходили, вязали сумки, собирали лебедей из полотенец. И это, ну реально это прям повезло. То есть я со своей психикой, если бы не оказалось вот в таких условиях, вот что там я в пятизвездочном отеле, не знаю, мне приносят еду, учат меня там из бамбука вязать сумку и делают со мной йогу по утрам, я вообще не знаю, что бы со мной было. Как будто бы меня предали, что ли, вот такое у меня было ощущение. То есть что у меня больше нет дома. То есть знаешь, у меня почему-то была абсолютная уверенность в первую же вообще неделю, что мне некуда возвращаться. И я до сих пор на самом деле так чувствую. Я много раз уже была в Москве, я все время гоняю в командировки. Вот это было гораздо страшнее, чем то, что ну посижу я на Бали. То есть как будто бы вот это чувство, оно было очень сильное, и надо было находить способы с ним справляться. И оно было настолько лидирующим в моем внутреннем оркестре чувств, что я даже не думала о том, что я буду здесь жить, не здесь жить. Я даже радовалась реально искренне, что вот я оказалась на бале. Это какой-то просто подарок судьбы был, что я правда в очень хороших условиях для того, чтобы проживать стресс вот так. Поэтому я скорее радовалась, что я на бале, а не где-то там в менее комфортных условиях. Потому что вот это ощущение, что тебе некуда больше возвращаться, оно у меня было очень-очень. И понимая просто, что мне некуда возвращаться, ну как бы я даже не анализировала, где я там буду жить в ближайшие годы. Я скорее... У меня была задача разобраться с бизнесом, наверное, вот такая основная. И в принципе наладить хоть какой-то быт day by day, ну такой at the moment, да, вот в сегодняшнем дне. Ну потому что там сразу же начались вот эти истории с карточками, да. То есть я скорее думала, как мне завести карту, да, как мне найти дом там, я не знаю, что мы будем делать с бизнесом, а не про какие-то там несколько лет или где я буду жить. О таких вещах я не думала.', '', 'А расскажи про бизнес, что ты сделала, что у тебя было самым главным, что нужно было сделать.', '', 'Хороший вопрос. Ну самое главное, что первое, что мы сделали, мы отменили наши развлекательные мероприятия и сделали несколько благотворительных. И я считаю, что мы абсолютно правильно поступили. То есть мы придумали прям новый такой благотворительно поддерживающий формат, он назывался Kinky Care. Он подразумевал просто то, что мы собрали людей и дали им инструменты, которые могут помочь пережить стресс. То есть там была лекция, такая лекция а-ля мастер-класс с упражнениями от психолога. А мы дали какие-то поддерживающие форматы, то есть там был психолог с мастер-классом и прямо с конкретными техниками, как помогать себе при стрессе. Вот там был Данил Королёв, это такой потрясающий певец с шаманским голосом, который устроил какое-то такое шаманское пение, тоже успокаивающее. Там была школа анимара, которая делала перформанс на хангах. Можно было просто прийти там без расхода, без билета, без всего и почувствовать, что ты не один. Вот нам казалось, что это самая важная идея. Сейчас объединить людей и дать вот это просто теплое плечо, где можно пообниматься. И поэтому мы, это первое, что мы сделали, мы заменили формат и вот в течение марта-апреля проводили такие мероприятия. А дальше на самом деле мы просто искали способы возобновить нашу деятельность. То есть параллельно мы думали, как нам развиваться где-то еще, но фокус все-таки был больше на том, как нам прожить те два месяца, в которых у нас не будет приходов, и каким-то образом оптимизировать так расходы, ну, как оптимизировать за счет урезания своих доходов. Вот, мы урезали себе доходы просто, команде мы все сохранили и, соответственно, ждали возможности. Мы первую вечеринку провели в конце апреля, на которую я как раз приехала в Москву. Но вот что мы делали главное в бизнесе, это, а, еще мы выпустили курс бесплатный, кажется, бесплатный, сейчас не помню, \"Как пережить стресс\". Я его как раз записывала на Бали. Вот, поэтому просто мы сфокусировались на том, как помочь людям сейчас. Ну, не, не \"как пережить стресс\", это я, а как, курс назывался \"Либидо и стресс\". То есть как сохранить либидо или просто со своим либидо вообще наладить отношения в период стресса. Ну, то есть тематический курс мы сделали.', '', 'И ты делала все это онлайн? Это, наверное, тоже добавляло сложности?', '', 'Да, но я еще лично для себя, на самом деле, это мой способ просто справляться со стрессом, я в ковид делала то же самое. Я начала давать еще бесплатные консультации по секс-коучингу. Для меня в такие моменты нужно всегда найти, ну, это лично моя история, мотивацию просыпаться по утрам, я ее теряю. Вот, и я забила себе расписание вот этими консультациями. И просто там у меня было в день по две-три консультации, я, наверное, штук 30 провела за март. Вот, и это помогало мне вот проснуться, потому что меня ждут люди, и дальше вот их обратная связь, благодарность и та польза, которую я вот реально в моменте приносила людям, она мне как-то помогала вообще справляться, потому что наши мероприятия тоже, но их все равно мы там, их несколько недель готовим, ждем, потом какой-то большой эффект. А вот эти маленькие, маленькая польза, она очень круто работает. Я всегда этим пользуюсь. Прикольно. А какие-то еще были у тебя такие вещи, которые тебя поддерживали в первое время? Да, я каждый день делала йогу. Это вообще был момент, когда я начала делать йогу. Но точнее я начала делать йогу в январе случайно, потому что я была на Пангане, там тоже все с утра до ночи делают йогу. Я никогда не делала йогу в своей жизни, никогда вообще не понимала, зачем это надо и что это за фигня такая. Но на Пангане я за компанию раза три сходила, и даже подумала, что это прикольно. И как раз поэтому, когда я оказалась на Бали, и я вдруг вспомнила, что есть такой инструмент, начала его делать, и мне это реально помогало. То есть у меня очень жесткий установился график дня, то есть я вставала, начинала всегда утро с йоги, готовила завтрак на всех, там мы жили с ребятами в коливинге. И дальше у меня начинались консультации. Вот этот жесткий распорядок йога и какой-то такой понятная рутина, и вот консультации меня поддерживали.', '', 'А ты йогу прям ходила куда-то с тренером, там, не знаю, долго занималась или сама по себе?', '', 'Нет, просто открыла бесплатный YouTube-канал по йоге, \"Boha Beautiful\" называется, самый популярный, и делала самые простые тренировки, 10-15-минутные, потому что на больше мне не хватало сил. Вот самые элементарные, просто вот иногда там полежать на коврике уже хорошо. Ну то есть ты как составила себе расписание вещей, которые тебе помогают? Да, да. И еще я очень много в сториз делилась, это мне тоже, кстати, помогало, потому что много было обратной связи. Я даже помню, что я в первые дни прям сделала опрос, надо ли мне... То есть за то, что моя очень красивая балийская жизнь с бассейнами, полями и пальмами мне казалась неприличной, и я очень много... Ну то есть у меня была радость за то, что я в этом оказалась, но у меня было очень много стыда за то, что оно есть. Ну знаешь, вот эта история, да, когда ты со своими привилегиями там как-то уживаешься. Вот, и я прям делала опрос, типа, ребята, могу вообще уйти, могу не выкладывать там, как лучше поступить? И большинство написали, что их поддерживают мои там зеленые пейзажи, и я продолжила и много очень выкладывала в сториз, общалась с людьми.', '', 'Наверное, расскажи теперь про Бали с точки зрения быта. Многие были там недельку-две, влюбились и уехали домой, но кажется, что пока мало еще из наших знакомых жили там по году, по полтора. Что происходит?', '', 'На Бали, по моему мнению, очень удобный часовой пояс, но это вот сильно зависит, да, то есть, например, у меня сейчас, возможно, так сменится рабочий режим, что он у меня сразу станет неудобным, потому что если вы работаете, ну вот как-то в московском часовом поясе, плотненько, с командой, и у вас много звонков, то, скорее всего, Бали - неподходящее место. Но если вы предприниматель или предпринимательница, и вы можете сами настраивать, или фрилансер, да, который не привязан к большому количеству звонков, и можно самостоятельно настроить распорядок дня, то Бали - это просто лучшее место, потому что звонки московские начинаются здесь днем, ну, типа там с двух-трех часов дня. Вот, это значит, что утром никто... все спят, и никто вас не трогает, никто не звонит, не пишет. Вот, можно роскошно заниматься своими делами, вот, ходить на йогу, хотя вот я сейчас переехала в другой район, и на йогу так часто сейчас не хожу, как в районе, где все ходят. Ну, тут еще разные районы, сейчас чуть попозже об этом расскажу. Но, наверное, из таких вот, ну, явных каких-то особенностей, это вот часовой пояс, тут надо просто понять, либо он вам подходит, либо нет, и если подходит, то это кайфово. Я прям с большим удовольствием здесь работаю. Здесь огромный нетворк, и это то, почему здесь классно жить. Я, например, считаю, что для отпуска лучше подойдет Таиланд, потому что там, ну, там круто отдыхается, там намного лучше пляжи, намного лучше море, намного лучше песок, вот, там как-то порасслабленнее. Здесь нет вообще пляжного отдыха, просто это вот некоторые ожидают его, и это такое большой, ну, не миф, а заблуждение у некоторых людей, что они приедут на Бали, типа остров, и тут пляжно отдохнут. Пляжно отдохнуть тут очень сложно, здесь скалы, очень грязно, мелкие пляжи и огромные волны, поэтому тут серфинг. Поэтому мне кажется, здесь прикольно именно жить, а не отдыхать, вот, но смотря какого отдыха вы хотите.', '', 'Потому что здесь очень много разнообразных людей, тут очень много предпринимателей, и мне здесь прям классно. Я за полтора года познакомилась, ну, с огромным количеством новых людей, и часть из них стали моими друзьями. Для меня это очень большая ценность, потому что тут реально классные люди живут. Не все, понятно, здесь очень разные люди живут, я бы так сказала, не то, что там все классные выбирают Бали, там они классные, а не Бали, это, конечно же, не так. Здесь просто настолько много русских, настолько огромная комьюнити, просто гигантская, что получается, что как бы и классных людей много. Здесь разные, я повторюсь, но лично мне вот это, это было для меня очень большим плюсом, что я оказалась тут, потому что есть с кем общаться.', '', 'А расскажи сразу про русских. Вот много русских, все про это знают, но никто не знает, как балийцы к этому относятся.', '', 'Да, балийцы очень по-разному к этому относятся, потому что русские тоже очень разные. Да, есть те, которые... Тем, которым очень сложно ассимилироваться в культуру, из-за таких ребят бывают иногда вот такие недопонимания, да, проблемы, потому что все-таки здесь очень-очень отличный от нас менталитет, очень своя уникальная на самом деле, реально культура, она уникальная, потому что Бали - это остров в составе Индонезии, который абсолютно на Индонезию не похож. Вот это, мне кажется, тоже такой важный элемент. То есть Бали - это такое государство в государстве. Как бы получается, что культура Бали, она и на индонезскую совершенно не похожа, потому что Индонезия - это мусульманская страна, азиатская, довольно бедная. То есть если выехать на любой соседний остров, можно встретить, ну, такую, ну, обычную, бедную мусульманскую страну. Вот женщины покрыты, много мечетей, абсолютный вот такой, я не знаю, низкий, принизкий уровень жизни, и все такое грустненькое. Вот это на любом острове Индонезии. Ну, не на любом, там будет по-разному, но тем не менее я покаталась по ним, видела что-то похожее. Бали, когда-то, это вот, ну, есть такая легенда, я не факт-чекала, прям, историческую точность, но расскажу, что когда как раз-таки мусульмане завоевывали Индонезию, насаждали там ислам, то было очень много знати, такой элиты, это были, ну, вот прям придворные, артисты, художники, поэты, в общем, вот те люди, с которыми непонятно было, что делать, они как бы там не готовы были подчиняться, но как-то и убивать их было неприкольно, и их сослали на Бали, как в некое гетто, типа, ладно, ребята, вот живите вот здесь все, как бы у нас будет тут, мы все равно здесь, везде будет ислам, но вы тут у себя, вот на одном острове тусуйтесь, как хотите. Так родилась вот эта история, потому что Бали - это остров художников, тут реально такой вот вайп-арта вообще во всем присутствует, и это даже в каких-то прикладных вещах, например, если здесь строится, все знают, что строителей надо нанимать с острова Ява, потому что на Бали все настолько художники, что они рутинную работу делают просто, ну, не то, что они могут делать очень долго, они все время отвлекаются, зато они классно там вырезают по дереву, рисуют, здесь просто весь остров, он в каком-то арте, причем на всех виллах обязательно будет очень много арт-объектов, ну, куча мест, где можно эти арт-объекты купить, то есть реально Бали - это остров художников.', '', 'А есть на Бали какое-нибудь слово, которое обозначает типа там спокойствие, расслабленность? Как \"сабай-сабай\" в Таиланде? \"Сабай-сабай\" в Таиланде, \"полако\" в Сербии, короче, во всех странах, где я был, в южных, все русские говорят, вот у них есть одно слово, они его каждый раз говорят, когда мы злимся, что что-то идет не так. Да-да-да, \"маньяна\" еще говорят. \"Маньяна-маньяна\".', '', 'Слушай, знаешь, тут, кстати, про такое, то есть если это слово и есть, то я его не знаю, а это значит, что оно не настолько прям распространенное, потому что они так живут просто day by day, то есть им не нужно это слово, у них это прям в крови. Я жила 9 месяцев с семьей балийской, то есть я жила в таком большом доме, который они один этаж сдавали мне, а на втором жили сами, и мы с ними прям вот, я жила с ними постоянно, я видела их быт, я видела их жизнь, это реально, они встают, они три раза в день точно молятся, может быть, чуть больше, но они не как мусульмане молятся, они обносят весь дом подношениями, палочками, потом они там сидят, у них огромный храм внутри каждого дома, гигантский, красивый, такой весь тоже, с кучей-кучей разных арт-элементов, да, расписанных, вот, и они реально, они такие спокойные, расслабленные, то есть мне кажется, что им даже слова не нужно, они вообще не понимают, как можно по-другому. То есть я, например, общалась тоже с Ваяном, у которого вот я жила, и он такой, я вообще никуда не путешествую, как я, говорит, могу оставить свой дом, а кто будет молиться, а кто будет там менять в храме подношения два раза в день, а кто будет там, у них у дома, например, есть день рождения, у них у всех вещей есть день рождения, абсолютно у всех, у Байка есть день рождения, вот у дома есть день рождения, и мы недавно выяснили, что у нашего дома два дня рождения, потому что день рождения дома два раза в году, и они его празднуют, то есть они реально делают огромную церемонию, там день рождения байка, на день рождения дома, там на день рождения всего, и мне кажется, что у них даже слова такого, оно не распространено, потому что они, они такие, и поэтому, когда они сталкиваются, ну, если говорить про русских, с русскими, которые там, надо быстро, надо срочно, там, или могут, не знаю, как-то жестко что-то требовать, они просто в шоке и такие, типа, чё, в смысле? И плюс они очень религиозные, они супер религиозные, я, кстати, да, недорассказала, в итоге, ислам здесь очень мало представлен, практически не представлен, здесь, на самом деле, пять официальных религий на Бали, но самая основная - это вот этот такой балийский индуизм, это помесь буддизма, индуизма и каких-то их балийских легенд и верований, вот, он абсолютно уникальный, вот эта, ну, вот эта религия, даже не знаю, как её назвать, она, она такая самобытная, своя и очень сильно отличается от вообще всего, что, в общем, от всего она отличается, вот, и они очень, очень много молятся, они верят в духов, они верят в карму, во всё, в общем, вот это верят, и поэтому какое-то ещё такое, немножко вызывающее поведение, русских тоже им кажется непонятным и странным, вот, некоторые здесь самовыражаются достаточно ярко, это правда, вот, и поэтому есть те, кто, кто этого боится, и они сразу экстраполируют это на всех русских, вот, есть те балийцы, которые понимают, что русские, на самом деле, развивают экономику и приносят деньги, но это надо, это скорее надо прям уметь анализировать, да, это вообще не всем, ну, как бы не у всех такое видение далеко, а пропаганда тут довольно интересно работает, потому что с одной стороны пропаганда дружит, вообще индонезийское правительство, индонезийское, оно дружит с русским правительством, и поэтому, ну, пропаганда у них такая же, как у нас, вот, с одной стороны, но с другой стороны, у балийского правительства есть, вот, как мне кажется, это моя вообще субъективная догадка, но это мое наблюдение, что у балийского правительства есть какие-то, какие-то терки с индонезийским правительством, потому что они всё-таки очень особенная вообще история, вот, и поэтому здесь бывает иногда такие настроения, что типа понаехали, ну, то есть именно пропагандистами закидываются в такой, в простой народ, типа, чё они тут понаехали, короче, надо их всех выгнать, вот, и поэтому у балийцев разное мнение, можно встретить такое радикально негативно настроенное, можно, ну, наш, например, воян, у которого вот мы жили, он очень-очень позитивно, очень с большим каким-то уважением и благодарностью говорит, что, во-первых, я вижу, что все русские разные, во-вторых, я понимаю, что вот вы даёте нам работу, вы арендуете наши дома, наши байки, едите нашу еду, как бы всё это нашу экономику поддерживает, поэтому я вам за это благодарен, там буду рад в этом поучаствовать, но, во-первых, не все видят вот эту связь, вот, и поэтому настроения очень разные, иногда вот в апреле была прям какая-то такая публичная, ну, травля, наверное, я даже не знаю, как это сказать, вот, потом, потом она приостановилась, потому что публично перестали это массировать в СМИ и в каких-то медиа, и, в общем-то, как бы, несмотря на то, что ни один процесс не остановился, там процесс, что миграционная служба очень внимательно следит за тем, кто по каким визам живёт и кто по каким визам работает, вот, и в момент, когда это ещё и сопровождалось медийной, активной пиар-компанией, вот, прям были такие настроения очень яркие у народа, но потом медийная пиар-компания пропала, хотя, ну, процессы абсолютно те же продолжились, и, собственно, настроения поменялись. Ну, то есть, какое-то, какие-то, не знаю, вещи происходят, да, в отношении миграции стороны русских, но это не системные действия, там, не знаю, законы не принимают, налоги не повышают, вот этого не происходит. Ну, вот про это все время, все время какие-то новости выходят, которые все начинают обсуждать, то есть тут ещё какая-то история есть, что во всяких предвыборных гонках постоянно какие-то даются обещания странные, типа там, мы сделаем, не знаю, налог на туризм, или мы запретим туристам арендовать байки, или мы там, то есть все время какие-то утки в СМИ появляются, и потом в чатах они тоже появляются, и все там их обсуждают, или там вот это была история про то, что запрет на проживание что-то в одном номере, если вы не женаты, вот что-то такое, но потом тоже там есть у всех этих законов, которые так и не принимаются на самом деле, есть всякие оговорки, то есть это, например, распространялось только на индонезов, и как я понимаю, они таким образом хотели просто сократить количество там половых контактов индонезов и туристов, ну, потому что все-таки они мусульман, там, как бы на законодательном уровне это мусульманская страна, то есть тут как бы очень все сложно, но это тоже всех пугали, мне писали, Таня, как ты там дальше будешь оставаться, у вас же там запрещен вообще внебрачный секс и жить нельзя в отеле, если вы там не женаты, но как бы у этих законов есть очень много \"но\", которые позволяют на самом деле понять, что это не касается туристов, а во-вторых, их, по-моему, даже не принимают в итоге, просто в качестве предвыборных каких-то гонок они их бесконечно муссируют в прессе.', '', 'Скажи, наверное, как раз вот про законы, про визы, если кто-то хочет приехать на Бали и остаться надолго, как это правильно сделать?', '', 'Да, вот это, кстати, интересный такой момент, потому что здесь есть визы полугодовая, она оформляется на два месяца первый раз, и потом ты ее просто продлеваешь, это какой-то самый, наверное, такой удобный, понятный вариант для того, чтобы пожить какое-то время. Вот, есть виза on arrival, которая оформляется прямо в аэропорту, и она ставится на месяц, и ты потом ее можешь продлевать, кажется, один раз, но может быть два, я точно не уверена, она получается там на два-три месяца, точно не могу сказать, наверное, на один раз можно продлевать. Вот, и есть разные там варианты различных виз. Вот, здесь есть KITAS, это некий аналог ВНЖ, который дается на два года, вот, и он может быть разным, он может быть рабочий, если ты работаешь, и там как-то он оформляется довольно сложно. Есть инвесторский, и тот, по которому сейчас очень многие здесь находятся, он как-то звучит так, что если ты инвестируешь в экономику, в развитие Бали, в какую-то сумму, то, собственно, ты можешь просто пребывать на территории, пользоваться резидентскими правами, но не имеешь права на работу. Поэтому кто-то здесь открывает компании, реально работающие как бизнесы, там, делают себе рабочие KITAS для того, чтобы развивать свои бизнесы, кто-то остается по вот этим инвесторским KITAS, вкладывается деньгами и, соответственно, просто здесь пребывает. Иногда так бывает, что вот эти компании инвесторские, инвесторские KITAS, так называемые, не все, как бы, эти компании прямо реально работают, вот, и это как бы такая наполовину серая схема, и, насколько я слышала, вот сейчас буквально информация от последних пары недель, проверки по ним планируют учистить, то есть проверять там, насколько это там реальные компании, как это все работает, с одной стороны, но с другой стороны, они собираются вводить годовую визу, которая может позволять мультивъезд, то есть все визы, про которые я сначала сказала, вот полугодовая, там двухмесячная, они все, они все, как бы, не мультивизитные, то есть ты немножко привязан по датам, то есть там у тебя определенные сроки, когда тебе надо делать виза раны, если ты вылетел, например, раньше этого срока, то тебе надо новую визу оформлять, то есть она одноразовая, вот, а эта виза, вот про которую сейчас говорят, она будет годовая, ты можешь туда-сюда ездить по ней, может быть, есть какие-то по ней права, но, как я понимаю, это некий аналог вот этого инвесторского китоса, то есть они видят, что очень многие сейчас оформляют их именно, потому что хотят оставаться здесь, в принципе, не хотят здесь работать, то что есть какой-то онлайн работа или там доход, не знаю, у всех разные ситуации, вот, и, соответственно, как бы, вот, как я вижу, вот эти проверки по этим китосам, они сопряжены с неким предложением нового решения, то есть, типа, мы вот вам предлагаем более легальный способ, вот смотрите, купите годовую визу с мультивъездом, но мы начнем проверять ваши китосы, и говорят, что вот эта история с китосами инвесторскими скоро прикроется.', '', 'Пока не приняли, все-таки правильно этот китос оформлять?', '', 'Ну, я бы порекомендовала дождаться годовую визу, я бы, потому что, то есть на Бали вот эти проверки, они такие стихийные, частые, тут, как бы, то есть, наверное, сейчас, если надо въезжать, я бы рекомендовала, вот эта годовая виза, ее, типа, там, знаешь, на прошлой неделе запустили, то есть, или она запускается на это, и вот она вот-вот выкатится, будет релиз ее, и если ехать вот прям сейчас и что-то оформлять, и хочется надолго, ну, то есть сейчас вот многие едут, кто-то оформляет себе, там, не знаю, на полгода, на, там, два месяца, вот, но если сразу хочется надолго, я бы рекомендовала оформить себе годовую визу, мне кажется, что это более safe вариант.', '', 'А вот интересно, Бали небольшой остров, и сюда приехало много людей, это как-то сказывается, там, на стоимости аренды, на доступности жилья вообще, или все еще нормально?', '', 'Тут сезоны, очень много людей было зимой, и это сказалось и на аренде, и на пробках просто нечеловеческих, огромных, жестких, вот, и это несмотря на то, что на самом деле Бали очень большой остров, просто он, как Россия, извините за сравнение, не заселен, то есть в нем заселены буквально вот несколько участков, и даже не то, что заселены, у меня, например, были фантазии, когда я только приехала и начала путешествовать по острову, я прямо увидела, как красиво на севере, я такая, господи, какой офигительно красивый север, и так как это вот как раз были первые месяцы в стрессе, и как бы у меня не было там сил на социализацию, я думаю, блин, а почему бы просто не переехать на север, там очень дешево, потому что далеко от инфраструктуры, и просто там пожить, и в итоге я приняла решение этого не делать, потому что там вообще нет инфраструктуры, то есть там не только нет людей, что в целом у меня было абсолютно окей, там нет магазинов, там нет аптек, там нет, ну, каких-то вещей, которые тебе нужны для жизни, и эта ситуация на самом деле практически, ну, 70% острова точно, то есть он огромный, но он просто такой вот диковатый, но есть вот эти огромные города и агломерации, в которых есть просто там на каждом шагу супермаркеты, макдональдсы, да, там магазины, торговые центры, и это не очень большая площадь, и поэтому, когда приезжает много людей, вот внутри них начинаются какие-то адовые пробки. Вот в апреле все уехали, я вот все лето провела здесь в совершенно потрясающих условиях, потому что и цены понизились, и там появилось гораздо больше предложений и по жилью, и по байкам, и пробки просто исчезли, просто пробок сейчас нету, вот. И самое еще удивительное с Бали, это для меня всегда загадка, что здесь летом и погода тоже лучше, причем намного, потому что здесь сухой сезон, и если зимой льют дожди, то летом их просто нету, и погода не просто, не просто дождей нету, еще и температура падает, то есть температура становится суперкомфортной, нету дождей, нету людей, и дешево, и как бы это все магия и мистика, потому что я вот, ну, сижу в чатах и вижу, как люди уже начинают потихоньку подгребать обратно, и к ноябрю собираются обратно все вернуться и снова вот эту вот дождливую, пробочную зиму проводить тут, то есть тут есть сезонность. Но она какая-то обратная получается. Ну, все как бы привыкли, видимо, зимой зимовать, вот, хотя здесь летом офигенно, но я еще слышала, еще как-то это связано с серферами, все-таки Бали - это остров серферов, и зимой намного лучше swell, волны, в общем, я не очень в этом разбираюсь, но еще с этим связано, то есть люди там готовы терпеть пробки и дожди, потому что они ради волн привлекают.', '', 'Окей, следующий вопрос у меня был про то, что ты разобралась со своим российским бизнесом, но ты же еще запустила новый проект, будучи на Бали. Да. Вот мне интересно, как в ситуации такого, как бы переезда и смены локации происходило запуск чего-то совсем нового?', '', 'Сейчас расскажу, потому что на самом деле для меня очень важный... Это происходило постепенно, точно не резко, и это были некие этапы, и первый этап был для меня, это он назывался \"Вечеринки на Бали\", вот, я их провела всего две, но это было суперважно, вот, как раз для какой-то вот такой части про самореализацию, вот, и первую я провела прямо в мае, то есть практически сразу, как только я приехала, я приехала, получается, в марте, вот, и уже в мае я провела первую вечеринку, и это было какое-то вот тоже, ну, такая поддержка, да, что я как бы, ну, во-первых, делаю что-то полезное, во-вторых, я могу делать что-то полезное, вот эта история про то, что у меня получается, да, я справляюсь, я способна даже в таких стрессовых вотрыве от дома ситуации что-то сделать и собрать своими руками, вот, для меня это был очень-очень крутой и классный опыт, вот, это было в мае, вторую я провела в декабре, потому что потом что-то все лето у меня ушло дальше на мои, на самом деле, ее было так тяжело проводить, я так охерела, что я отдыхала потом три месяца просто, вот, а потом, потом что-то у меня случились какие-то тоже мои, очень-очень много изменений снова резко, я рассталась с молодым человеком осенью, вот, забрала сына, потому что случилась мобилизация, и я вернулась на Бали, я съездила в Россию, вернулась уже с сыном, и как-то опять все стало по новому, и в декабре я провела вторую вечеринку, и она тоже меня очень поддержала, то есть у меня вот был вот эти полгода, за которые я провела две вечеринки на Бали, и они дали мне как-то почувствовать себя очень уверенно, навык вот этот, знаешь, собирать в абсолютно неизвестных новых условиях команду и что-то создавать, вот, я как-то прокачала этот навык, и больше я вечеринок не делала, вот, на самом деле я хотела сделать еще несколько вечеринок, потому что я здесь уже прям наладила вот эту всю схему, модель, но так как здесь для того, чтобы сделать что-то, ну, по крайней мере, это касается вечеринок точно, я про другие бизнесы не буду говорить, очень много нужно пройтись по всяким инстанциям и дать взяток, это некий просто часть процесса, ты без него никак не можешь, из-за этого у меня и был стресс каждый раз, потому что для меня это прям тоже перешагивание через себя, вот, и как ни странно, все последующие вечеринки у меня не получилось, потому что вот эти взяточные органы мне больше, мои взятки не принимали, назовем это так. А с чем это может быть связано с тем, что все-таки у тебя такие совсем несовместимые с мусульманскими ценностями вечеринки? Слушай, на самом деле это скорее связано с тем, что вот действительно в 23-м году началась вот эта миграционная чистка, там, так называемая или так не называемая, правда, очень многих депортировали, и у меня вечеринка стояла на апрель, и именно в апреле была прямо очень такая мощная волна, то есть реально всех, кто работал, то есть там самая, на самом деле, здесь лютая служба - это миграционная, то есть здесь понятно, что надо заносить и полиции, и специальной религиозной полиции, у нее есть свое название, отдельные тоже инстанции, она еще больше, чем обычная полиция, но как бы больше всех ты заносишь, и страшнее всех, всех кошмарит миграционная служба, которая просто смотрит, работаете вы с китосами или без, а рабочий китос получить очень сложно, как я уже сказала, то есть я живу не по рабочему китосу здесь, они как бы так гребут, что типа даже если ты там просто, знаешь, колонку переставил из одного угла в другой, и у тебя китоса не было, значит, ты грузчик без китоса вон с нашего острова, как бы им заносят все, потому что, ну, очень сложно там на всех оформить китос, просто нереально на всю команду, и вот они мне как раз, то есть я попробовала в апреле сделать, ну, там реально настолько была массовая вот эта вот депортация, что я сама приняла решение отложить, потом в июле я попробовала еще раз, и мне сказали, что массовая депортация продолжается, просто это убрали из СМИ, а на самом деле продолжают также за всеми следить, всех смотреть, и лучше пока ничего не делать, и поэтому больше я попыток не предпринимала, но, насколько я слышу, повторюсь, просто вот из СМИ это убрали, а вот этот вот процесс, он остался, то есть скорее это связано с тем, что просто они пытаются урегулировать тех, кто работает здесь среди русских, ну, потому что действительно очень многие русские здесь открывают бизнес, работают, зарабатывают, а они очень заботятся тем, чтобы мы не отбирали рабочие места индонезов, скорее вот так. Соответственно, дальше после этого периода у меня там еще происходили с дипом трансформации, да, потому что первое, что мы сделали, мы перевелись на английский, как-то тоже у меня вот этот вот мой такой шок и ужас от травмы, от того всего, того, что произошло, она как-то меня мотивировала отказаться от русскоязычного рынка, по крайней мере в новом проекте, в котором еще его ничего не сформировано. Вот, я перевелась на английский, мы попробовали запуститься на американском рынке, и у нас не получилось, и поэтому мы проект перестановили, пока, в общем, что-то не произойдет кардинально новое, и дальше я просто на полгода ушла в такой саббатикал, то есть у меня оставались скинки, но все остальные проекты я перестановила, то есть и вот внутри этого саббатикала у меня начали как раз какие-то новые идеи рождаться, ну, вот это отвечая на этот вопрос, как что-то новое родилось, и первая моя новая идея была давно, хотя она очень мне нравилась, вот, я прям с таким удовольствием фигачила там месяц сама над этой новой идеей, но абсолютно никакого отклика она не получила, просто, просто ноль, ноль реакции, ноль отклика там, знаешь, ноль заявок, ноль всего, вот, я такая, окей, все понятненько, отмотаем назад, вот, и все, пару месяцев походила со свежей головой, там еще немножко как-то пожила, вот, и идея новая просто пришла ко мне из какой-то вот такой саморефлексии и от того, что мозг освободился, отдохнул и увидел какие-то новые интересные решения, вот, и соответственно, буквально месяц назад я запустила, да, новый проект, который называется Аскеза, и он помогает, это такое просвещение и помощь людям, которые в зависимости или людям, которые могут попасть в зависимость, вот, и он как-то родился действительно из вот этого, знаешь, из пространства, которое я отдала сама себе, своему вот этому творческому мышлению, потому что сам проект родился вот в одном из брейнштормов там с подругой, то есть я много времени проводила на океане, много времени проводила как раз там с подругой, просто отдыхала, и мы что-то брейнштормили и поняли, что классно будет сделать такой бот, который помогает тебе держать Аскезу, собственно, сделали его там за несколько недель, запустили, вот, и сейчас его развиваем.', '', 'Так, так давай к последнему блоку вопросов, расскажи, кому бы ты не советовала на Бали соваться?', '', 'Хороший такой вопрос, потому что у острова есть, знаешь, вот этот магический элемент, про него очень много говорят, я думаю, я чуть-чуть про него тоже расскажу, да, вот это остров, ну, над ним все шутят бесконечно в инстаграме, это правда очень смешно, значит, остров принял, остров не принял, вот это все там, тебя там колбасит, я скорее, знаешь, как это вижу, что тут реально довольно специфические условия, как будто бы, если у тебя есть ожидания определенные, ну, например, что здесь будет как в Москве, или что здесь будет как в Таиланде, или там, что здесь будет как, и дальше там, подставь любое ожидание, которое может сформироваться от людей, вот с этими ожиданиями здесь реально сложновато, потому что ты все время как бы будешь сталкиваться с реальностью, что здесь вообще не так, и я встречала людей, которые тут и болеют, и расстраиваются, и вообще там улетают сразу, потому что они в шоке, поэтому, если у вас есть какие-то ожидания от Бали, то, наверное, они могут не оправдаться вот так, без кого, возможно, они оправдаются, вот, но могут и не оправдаться, это будет не очень прикольно, поэтому я бы не рекомендовала ехать сюда с ожиданиями. По поводу, кому бы подошло, кому бы нет, я искренне считаю, что Бали - это очень крутой, полезный, классный опыт, который вообще-то полезен всем, но если вы не готовы к опыту, то, наверное, тоже...', '', 'Слушай, а вот ты сказала еще про то, что большое сообщество, кого Бали притягивает?', '', 'Ну, тут еще вот по районам, сейчас я тогда расскажу по районам, здесь очень разная вообще история, я даже писала, я помню пост, что каждый район Бали, он очень напоминает отдельные города в России, и можно прям такую вот проводить аналогию очень прямую, и такая она правда работает. Вот здесь, например, есть [[🏙 Убуд|Убуд]]. [[🏙 Убуд|Убуд]] находится в центре острова, это культурная столица Бали, его называют сердце острова, да, вот все дела, и это классический Санкт-Петербург, вот реально. Там, значит, там все такие просветленные, да, вот этот уже стал мемом, вот это убуднутые, там убудские. Я прожила там больше года в Убуде и вот в его окрестностях, и реально там можно встретить вот это все энергопрактики, холотропное дыхание, там все ходят, я не знаю, в лосинах и в халатах, да, там это правда, это все прям правда, если честно, у меня очень смешная есть история, прям ужасно смешная.', '', 'Я сейчас переехала из Убуда в [[🏙 Ченгу|Ченгу]], Ченгу - это такая типа а-ля Москва, тут куча фэнси-кафешек, тут серферы, всякие там красивые виллы и океан, и здесь такой движняк, здесь много каворкингов, очень много спортзалов. Знаешь, как меня подруга называла [[🏙 Ченгу|Ченгу]]? Как? Ченгушетия. Ченгушетия, да, да, да, так говорят, Ченгушетия. Вот, и я сейчас сюда переехала, и я прям реально чувствую, как сменился мой вайп, и я, знаешь, приезжаю в Убуд к своим друзьям на прошлой неделе, потому что у меня там куча друзей, естественно, осталось, вот, я приезжаю, ну, просто, значит, и у нас было там какое-то какао-церемонии, в общем, ну, просто поболтать и попить какао, вот, и тут приезжает моя подружка и смотрит на меня вот так, и такая, не видно, как она смотрит, но у нее очень широко раскрыты глаза, и она просто в шоке зависает на минуту и говорит на меня, Таня, это что, на тебе надет пиджак? А на мне реально пиджак. И она такая, просто она такая, что с тобой случилось? Я говорю, Ань, я переехала в Ченгу. Она, ааа, ты переехала в Ченгу? Я говорю, да, я еще в кроссовках. Она такая, и в кроссовках, и она просто не могла успокоиться, вот, при том, что она сама там до этого полгода жила в Ченгу. Она говорит, когда я жила в Ченгу, я просто тусила по фэнси-барам с коктейлем вот так в руке, и типа бесконечно, значит, работала, и тоже ходила в пиджаках. А сейчас, посмотри, я даже, ну, и она, наверное, как бы она это говорила в шутку, но это, блин, не шутка. Она такая, я голову не мою, с утра у меня аштанга в 7 утра, потом я, значит, тусуюсь в веганских кафешках, да, там, вечером я пою киртаны, и это все правда, то есть зависит очень сильно от района. Как бы вот в Убуде собраны все как бы просветленные, но, если честно, в большинстве это сумасшедшие, там очень много наркотиков, вот, и это, ну, вот как в Питере примерно. В Питере тоже, по моему субъективному, возможно, стереотипному мнению, очень много наркотиков и наркоманов, все такие расслабленные, дедлайны не слышали. В общем, и в Убуде такие люди, вот, им там кайфово, они там живут, и я первое время, на самом деле, тоже жила в Убуде именно по этой причине, потому что я была на таком стрессе, что мне вот именно там было хорошо, я прям там чувствовала, что я восстанавливаюсь от стресса, отдыхаю, расслабляюсь. И как только я восстановилась, я переехала в Ченгу, потому что здесь реально какой-то вот другие люди, другой вайб, здесь больше предпринимателей, почти все предприниматели здесь, вот, здесь все время какие-то бизнес-встречи, какие-то бизнес-митапы, тут как бы нету так много там шаманов, не проходит такое большое количество вот каких-то там шаманских волшебных штук, вот здесь больше как-то вот типа все по делу, вот здесь есть, например, остров, полуостров Букит, да, в котором есть [[🏙 Улуват|Улуват]], [[🏙 Уджинбаран|Уджинбаран]], вот там серферы, потому что там офигенные волны, там такой скалистый очень берег, это полуостров, и там просто ты приезжаешь, как будто ты приехал, я не знаю, ну, там вот эти полуголые в кубиках ходят с длинными вот этими волосами, вот они там в обнимку со своим серфом, там очень мало какой-то такой вот инфраструктуры, кроме кафешек и магазинов, там только вот поля, причем даже не рисовые, а какие-то просто сраненькие, вот, поля, скалы, серферы и кафешки, вот все на Улувату, да, там вот табуки, тебе больше ничего нет, поэтому как бы очень сильно зависит от того, какие люди, есть еще, например, [[🏙 Амед|Амед]], да, в Амеде просто вот если в Убуде такие просветленные в перемешку с разными людьми, то в Амеде просто только просветленные, там вообще все сидят, медитируют просто с утра до ночи, там небольшое комьюнити, человек 300-500, но это тоже довольно много на самом деле, вот, и они там, они там просто сидят в цене под вулканом, под огунгом, вот, поэтому здесь очень разные люди, прям очень разные, я вот тоже съездила в Убуд сейчас на выходных, снимали интервью, мы с Надей с Каской, как раз для Аскезы, вот, я туда съездила и прям хапнула всего, то есть сразу какой-то сумасшедший, что-то там мне сказал, что там он видит какую-то мою энергию просто моментально, потом что-то начал мне продавать какую-то свою херню, я прям еле-еле от него отвязалась, вот, и вот оно все сразу на тебя наскакивает, поэтому сюда очень разные люди приезжают, и в зависимости от района ты будешь сталкиваться и встречаться тоже с очень-очень разным типом людей, я бы так ответила на твой вопрос.', '', 'Значит, продолжаем, кому сюда не надо приезжать?', '', 'Значит, как я уже сказала, если часовой пояс привязан к московскому, то очень некомфортно, неудобно работать, вот, здесь есть какие-то свои особенности, ну, например, очень трудно жить с дорогой одеждой, даже не знаю, как это вот сформулировать, тут как бы настолько условия жизни изнашивают одежду, потому что здесь солнце, ветер, как бы грязь, байки и очень плохие прачечные, и отсутствие стиральных машинок, поэтому если как бы там вы хотите сохранить здесь свои какие-то дорогие там пиджаки или классные футболки или там, не знаю, шелковые вещи, то это прямо, ну, будет некомфортно, то есть можно вообще эти вещи не брать, потому что в убуде еще все плесневеет кожаное, вот, и Валя вообще учит к такому, знаешь, сменяемости бесконечной и непривязыванию, просто там, вот, просто вещи постоянно выкидываются или там, не знаю, портятся и как-то появляются новые или их количество сокращается, какая-то лакшери, жизнь здесь точно возможна, но вот в плане какого-то такого быта, да, надо понимать, что все быстро разлагается, там, плесневеет, портится в прачечных, это все превращается просто, в общем, надо прачечную подобрать, и то я даже вроде подобрала, и все равно мне все с пятнами вернули, в общем, ну, такое, немножко все очень быстро сменяется, и если, да, если для вас это большая ценность, к чему-то привязаться и чтобы с ним, вот, оно с вами было, то здесь будет некомфортно и неприкольно, а кому стоит приезжать, даже не знаю, вот если чувствуете, по-балийски мы ответим, то приезжайте, но здесь прикольно, мне кажется, что здесь для меня вот это было самое, наверное, ценное, я очень тревожный человек, прям, супер тревожный, и в Москве я уже давно для себя, прям, много лет назад поняла, что мне нельзя долго в Москве, и там, до ковида, например, я все время путешествовала в Европу, да, там, когда ковид начался, я начала путешествовать просто куда-нибудь, там, либо по России ездила, либо там, в Беларусь, либо в Азию, потому что Москва, она на мою тревожность действует, как, там, я не знаю, x10 к ней прибавляет, и я могу там до нервных срывов и до больничек доходить, а вот на Бали, наоборот, моя тревожность прям излечивается, здесь, как бы, все такое расслабленное, все такое вязкое, все какое-то такое, очень, вот, эта вот тропическая островная жизнь, легкая и какая-то такая ленивая, вот, она, например, для моей тревожности офигенно действует, потому что я чуть-чуть успокаиваюсь, все еще остаюсь в тонусе и становлюсь просто адекватным человеком, вот, наверное, тоже такое.', '', 'Супер. И последний вопрос, чему тебя научил переезд?', '', 'Так, чему меня научил переезд и долгая иммиграция? Ну, не привязываться тому, что я могу намного больше, чем мне кажется, да, что у меня есть классные ресурсы уже внутри меня, фокусу на себя, наверное, как-то это плохо сформулировано, ну, такой вот, знаешь, заботе о себе, с прицелом на то, что мне еще справляться, типа, вот, надо, надо take care, вот, что-то такое, и, наверное, еще быть более свободной, вот, это совершенно точно. Я уже вроде была свободной, мне кажется, но тут я прям, прям совсем освобождаюсь с каждым днем, все больше и больше. И ценить, как ни странно, я уже сказала, не привязываться, и мне кажется, что вот это очень круто в связке работает, с одной стороны не привязываться, а с другой стороны ценить то, что у тебя есть, и людей вокруг. Но мне кажется, в этом, вот этот баланс очень важно сохранять, да, что вот этот благодарность за то, что у тебя есть, и вот этот, какое-то внимание, забота и проявление того, что это ценно, во-первых, тому, что у тебя есть, а во-вторых, кто тебя окружает. Вот для меня, если честно, вот эта история про друзей, окружение и людей вокруг на бале как-то обострилась очень сильно. Но при этом давать вот эту свободу, да, что в любой момент это может поменяться, и это жизнь.'], subsections=[])])])\n",
